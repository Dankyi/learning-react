In this tutorial a state was declared in parent component App and was then 
passed a a prop to be accessed by another component (Box). This is what is 
referred to as derived state which is completely not needed as a state can
be declared once in the parent node and be inherited by all child nodes.
A problem that can arise by creating a state (out of the parent Node) via 
props in a child node is that when the state changes in the child node it
does not reflect in the parent node; changes only affect the child node.
So for the next task we refactor the code in this tutorial to make us of 
state in only the parent node (i.e. App.js) so the state can be passed on
or inherited by all child nodes once changes are made in the parent node.
